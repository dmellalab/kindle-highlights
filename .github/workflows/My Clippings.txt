Too much free time is no more than fertilizer for self-doubt and assorted mental tail-chasing. Subtracting the bad does not create the good. It leaves a vacuum. Decreasing income-driven work isn’t the end goal. Living more—and becoming more—is.

Focus on creating end-user demand so you can dictate terms. Often one trade publication advertisement, bought at discount remnant rates, will be enough to provide this leverage. Outside of science and law, most “rules” are just common practice. Just because everyone in your industry offers terms doesn’t mean you have to, and offering terms is the most consistent ingredient in start-up failure. Cite start-up economics and the ever-so-useful “company policy” as reasons for prepayment and apologize, but don’t make exceptions. Net-30 becomes net-60, which becomes net-120. Time is the most expensive asset a start-up has, and chasing delinquent accounts will prevent you from generating more sales.

That Fatal Assumption is: if you understand the technical work of a business, you understand a business that does that technical work. And the reason it’s fatal is that it just isn’t true. In fact, it’s the root cause of most small business failures! The technical work of a business and a business that does that technical work are two totally different things! But the technician who starts a business fails to see this. To the technician suffering from an Entrepreneurial Seizure, a business is not a business but a place to go to work. So the carpenter, or the electrician, or the plumber becomes a contractor. The barber opens up a barber shop. The technical writer starts a technical writing business. The hairdresser starts a beauty salon. The engineer goes into the semiconductor business.

So he works steadily and is happiest when he is in control of the work flow.

The business explodes, leaving behind people who most often justify the explosion as an inevitable consequence of doing business on a “fast track” where luck and speed and a brilliant bit of technological daring-do are the necessary components for making it big.

The Technician, on the other hand, looks inwardly, to define his skills, and only looks outwardly afterward to ask, “How can I sell them?” The resulting business almost inevitably focuses on the thing it sells rather than the way the business goes about it or the customer to whom it’s to be sold. Such a business is designed to satisfy The Technician who created it, not the customer.

Documentation provides your people with the structure they need and with a written account of how to “get the job done” in the most efficient and effective way. It communicates to the new employees, as well as to the old, that there is a logic to the world in which they have chosen to work, that there is a technology by which results are produced. Documentation is an affirmation of order. Again from Toffler: “…for many people, a job is crucial psychologically, over and above the paycheck. By making clear demands on their time and energy, it provides an element of structure around which the rest of their lives can be organized.”2 The operative word here is clear.

Only when the Sales Operations Manual is complete does Murray run an ad for a salesperson. But not for someone with sales experience. Not a Master Technician. But a novice. A beginner. An Apprentice.

Now Jack and Murray have learned, by experience, an important lesson in developing their business, a lesson every Technician suffering from an Entrepreneurial Seizure must learn if his business and his life are to work in harmony. That your Organization Chart flows down from your Strategic Objective, which in turn flows down from your Primary Aim. That each is the cause of the one preceding it, and each, therefore, plays a part in the fulfillment of the one before it. A logic is established, an integrated whole.

El primer elemento de cambio es la conciencia: no puedes cambiar algo a menos que conozcas su existencia. El segundo es la comprensión: entendiendo cuál es el origen de tu «forma de pensar» puedes reconocer que ésta procede de fuera de ti. El tercero es la disociación: una vez que te das cuenta de que esta forma de pensar no eres tú, puedes separarte de ella y decidir en el presente si conservarla o desprenderte de ella, basándote en quién eres hoy y en dónde quieres estar mañana.

La palabra decisión procede del término latino decidere, que significa «eliminar cualquier otra alternativa». Elegir es mejor, pero no lo mejor. El tercer nivel de querer es el de «me comprometo a ser rico». La definición del verbo comprometerse es «dedicarse sin reservas». Esto significa no retener absolutamente nada, dar el cien por cien de todo lo que tienes para obtener riqueza. Significa estar dispuesto a hacer lo que haga falta durante el tiempo que haga falta. Éste es el camino del guerrero: no hay excusas, no hay ningún «pero» que valga, ningún «quizás», ningún «tal vez»… y el fracaso no es una opción. El camino del guerrero es simple: «Seré rico o moriré en el intento».

If I were independent, physically, I could pretty well make it on my own. Mentally, I could think my own thoughts, I could move from one level of abstraction to another.

Many executives, managers, and parents swing back and forth, as if on a pendulum, from Win/Lose inconsideration to Lose/Win indulgence. When they can’t stand confusion and lack of structure, direction, expectation, and discipline any longer, they swing back to Win/Lose—until guilt undermines their resolve and drives them back to Lose/Win—until anger and frustration drive them back to Win/Lose again.

Desired results (not methods) identify what is to be done and when. Guidelines specify the parameters (principles, policies, etc.) within which results are to be accomplished. Resources identify the human, financial, technical, or organizational support available to help accomplish the results. Accountability sets up the standards of performance and the time of evaluation. Consequences specify—good and bad, natural and logical—what does and will happen as a result of the evaluation.

This principle is also true in sales. An effective sales person first seeks to understand the needs, the concerns, the situation of the customer. The amateur salesman sells products; the professional sells solutions to needs and problems. It’s a totally different approach. The professional learns how to diagnose, how to understand. He also learns how to relate people’s needs to his products and services. And, he has to have the integrity to say, “My product or service will not meet that need” if it will not.

Conversely, if there are large shareholders wanting to get rid of their shares, then this is a good point for them to liquidate their positions. They start selling their shares at the VWAP. The price will reject the VWAP and start to move down. This is an excellent short selling opportunity for day traders. If there is no interest in the stock from market makers or institutions, the price may trade sideways near VWAP. Wise traders will then stay away from that stock.

After volatility decreases around ten to fifteen minutes into the Open, the stock will move toward or away from the VWAP. This is a test to see if there is a large investment bank waiting to buy or sell. If there is a large institutional trader aiming to buy a significant position, the stock will pop over the VWAP and move even higher. This is a good opportunity for us day traders to go long.

I personally live video record all of my trades during the morning session (as I rarely make any trades Mid-day or at the Close). I believe traders, like athletes, should watch their trading videos. The best athletes and teams watch films of themselves to see what they’re doing right and wrong, and how best to improve. I will review my tapes during Mid-day and make sure to note important observations on my entry, exit, price action, Level 2 signals and so on. I try to learn as much as possible from my trades. Sometimes I look for new algorithmic programs that I must be aware of. I search for areas where I could have added more size. This is one of my trading weaknesses. I also do a poor job of holding for a longer time the stocks that are going in my favor. I therefore consider trades that I could have held longer. I make sure to find spots where I was too aggressive. I look for times where I took a trade even though it did not offer a good risk/reward opportunity. I review my position sizing and why and where I added more. That is How to Day Trade for a Living. There is no other way to get better. There are no excuses in trading.

However, because the discretionary trader must make a decision for each trade, traders are more prone to emotional trading and acts of self-deception, such as falling in love with a trade, that will often result in a failure to follow their trading plan.

In trading, you accept a loss, without questioning your strategy. You make another trade, and you accept another loss, and in the third trade, when it works in your favor, you make sufficient money to cover your previous losses, if you are using a risk/reward ratio higher than 1:3 in the execution of your strategy.

“How is it that some traders can make it and many fail despite having the same education and tools?” Why does that happen? What exactly is that quality, that attribute, that some people have but others do not? Why do very few new traders make it? And what makes others bend under the pressures of trading and ultimately fail? These questions have fascinated me ever since I started trading and later entered into the world of teaching and mentorship. The answer, in my opinion, is “resilience”.

My trading career has taught me much about resilience, although it’s a subject none of us will ever understand fully. Resilience is one of the greatest psychoanalytic puzzles of human nature, like creativity or the religious instinct. To get the exact answer, we have to look more deeply into the human psyche.

Previous day close is one of the most important levels on your charts.  Previous day’s high and low (usually Y and YY: yesterday and the day before) are important and some platforms will automatically draw these lines for you. In DAS, the PriceMarker Study will do that for you.  Clear pre-market levels (low and high) can often be important intraday levels.  Moving averages on both daily charts and intraday charts are also often important levels. The higher the moving average is, the stronger the level (for example, 200 SMA is a much more powerful level than 9 EMA). In addition, the higher the time frame the moving average is in, the stronger the level it is. For example, a 20 EMA moving average on a 5-minute chart is much stronger than 20 EMA on a 1-minute chart.  Extreme price levels on daily charts that the price has bounced back from are important levels. The kangaroo tails (large wicks to the upside or downside) are extremely important levels.  Always look at the most recent data to find levels, and try to find levels near the pre-market price. There is no point in finding levels that would be unlikely to be in the price action range for that day.  All-time highs, all-time lows, 52-week highs, and 52-week lows are also important levels that should be marked

Muchos de nosotros sabemos lo que debemos hacer mentalmente, pero la mayoría de las veces no sucede nada extraordinario, porque nuestra vida emocional está inmersa en el caos. Permanecemos anclados al pasado. No hemos perdonado lo imperdonable. Hemos reprimido todas las emociones generadas en nosotros por todos aquellos que nos han hecho daño.

Después saboteamos nuestras aspiraciones más elevadas con los residuos de nuestros corazones dañados. Así, nada cambia, nada aumenta, nada se transforma. Cuando se desea experimentar un crecimiento exponencial y lograr un rendimiento excepcional, es preciso programar un estado de la mente excelente, pero también reparar, reconstruir y reforzar las emociones para conseguir una disposición emocional que nos permita ir en pos de la victoria. En consecuencia, es imprescindible erradicar las emociones oscuras y tóxicas asociadas a dolores pasados. Hay que liberarse, limpiarse y purificarse. Para siempre. Y así el corazón, antes endurecido por las pruebas a las que le ha sometido la vida, volverá a abrirse en su más alto y noble esplendor.

También debo mencionar que, trabajar en la disposición emocional no solo consiste en eliminar las inquietudes negativas originadas por las frustraciones, las decepciones y las cargas de la vida. También hay que amplificar las emociones saludables.

El héroe no se hace grande durante los períodos de confort. Las ilustres y nobles almas de nuestro mundo se hacen fuertes, valerosas y éticas cuando afrontan resueltamente los embates de la adversidad, la dificultad y la duda. Es, pues, en el momento en el que afrontan su más profunda debilidad cuando tienen la oportunidad de forjar sus mayores fuerzas. El verdadero poder no procede, por tanto, de una vida de comodidad, sino de la de esfuerzo intenso, de la abnegada disciplina y de la actuación exigente en la dirección que tu yo supremo sabe correcta. Para continuar hasta el momento en el que tu dolor cese. Para avanzar cuando deseas abandonar.

Los grandes maestros, los genios y los héroes de la civilización viven todos ellos vidas muy arduas —prosiguió el millonario—. Su entrenamiento es muy duro. «Juegan con dolor», por tomar prestada una expresión que muchos deportistas de élite utilizan en la actualidad. Refuerzan su potencial con total entrega. Son ambiciosos y tenaces cuando se trata de lograr la completa capitalización de su mayor potencial. La raíz latina de la palabra «pasión» significa «sufrimiento». Estas mujeres y estos hombres sufren para ver cumplidos sus intuiciones, sus ideales y sus aspiraciones. Sufren por la elevación del nivel de sus capacidades y se sacrifican por la consecución de su pericia. Soportan una enorme angustia a medida que progresan en sus habilidades y abandonan sus tentaciones. Y también tengo que deciros que estos creadores excepcionales sufren por el estado del mundo. No mantenerse firme en el propio compromiso degrada nuestro mundo, en tanto que el planeta se convierte en un lugar peor sin la aportación de los más grandes.

Puedes dejarte paralizar por el miedo al rechazo o salir y dejar al mundo alucinado. Pero no puedes hacer las dos cosas. La realidad de la vida es que tienes un destino que clama por tu atención. Deja de maltratar tu grandeza y de negar tu esplendor tildando de fracaso lo que no salió como querías. Todos sabemos que cada revés conlleva una oportunidad de triunfo aún mayor. Y comienza a decir que sí más a menudo en tu vida. El valor es un arma exquisita, que derrota a los ejércitos del arrepentimiento que destrozan las vidas sumisas.

Here are the four things that cause traders to lose money: 1. Anyone who’s attracted to trading shares has the same characteristics as a psychopath. 2. The inherent freedom is destructive. After all, we spent our first 18 years of life learning that it’s better to follow the rules and do what we’re told. 3. The markets actually encourage and reinforce bad habits. 4. Traders are seduced into taking every opportunity to sell themselves on the idea that they’re right.

When you’re dancing with the market, it’s best to let the market lead. Once traders understand this, the next thing they need to work on is their own mental trading outlook and how they process this information, and to fully understand how the human brain naturally and emphatically causes traders to do things that make them lose money in the markets. It could be a whopper of a bad trade like Joe Trader’s or a series of smaller bad trades that grind down an account—death by a thousand cuts. Either way, it’s the human brain that’s letting it happen.

The moment you lose sight of money as a tool of the game and revert to thinking of it in terms of its purchasing power, you have sentenced yourself to playing less skillfully and more emotionally, which is poison to any trader.

What happens to traders in the beginning is that they naturally end up on a cycle in which they label themselves as good traders on days when they make money and as bad traders on days when they lose money. This is an ordinary reaction instilled in them based on the principles that apply to general society. After all, straight A’s mean that a student is a success, while F’s mean that a student is a failure, right?

“Learning how not to lose” is a simple way of summing up everything we’ve talked about up to this point. It’s about having the patience to wait, the courage to get out, and the integrity to follow your plan—all of that leads to learning how not to lose.

I have solved this problem by employing a strategy that I call the “plateau money management method” of managing my day-trading and swing-trading accounts. Specifically, this is for trading shorter-term, highly leveraged accounts such as futures, Forex, and options. I don’t use this methodology for longer-term investments.

When you use the “plateau money management method” to manage your gains, you have the added benefit of holding on to the capital you worked so hard to acquire. When you have a working methodology to focus on, you’re not just looking for the next winning trade. Though individual trades are obviously critical, when viewed through the lens of your grander plans, each trade becomes just a brick in the wall of wealth you’re building. Yes, some of those bricks will fall off the wall, but you’re building tools to replace those bricks and continue building.

When Jesse Livermore was in the process of making his fortune, one of his favorite quotes was, “If I bought a stock and it went against me, I would sell it immediately. You can’t stop and try to figure out why a stock is going in the wrong direction. The fact is that it is going in the wrong direction, and that is enough evidence for an experienced speculator to close the trade.”

Also, it’s important to realize that professional traders are not in every move. It’s okay to have the market leave the station without you. Catching every move is impossible, but chasing every move is the mark of an amateur. This is why it’s imperative for traders to have a set of rules to follow for both entries and exits, as opposed to relying on their own gut feelings to manage a position. Develop a set of rules and have the discipline to follow them; they exist for your protection.

My two best practical tips for turning into a profitable trader? First, try cutting your position size in half and doubling your stop. This usually fixes most problems. Next, focus on executing two well-thought-out, well-planned trades per week, instead of cranking out five trades per day. Easy peasy.

In a down market, fear drives decisions, and fear of loss will override nearly all arguments for calm and logic. In an up market, there is fear of missing a move combined with the euphoria of making money. In a sideways market, conviction is at low levels all around and boredom is often an overriding emotion.

These money-making thrusts and emotional reactions create support and resistance levels.

The only real danger in trading options is if you decide to sell them “naked.” Well, guess what. You never have to do that. A spread is just selling a naked option with a fixed amount of risk in place. What happens if you get assigned when you sell a spread? Your risk doesn’t change; only the margin requirements of the trade change. If you can handle the margin, keep the trade. If you can’t, then just close it out. By the way, getting assigned doesn’t happen very much. I’ve often held on to stock I was assigned after the spread expired and turned the trade into greater profitability. Again, your risk doesn’t change in this situation, while the spread is on, as the movement in the stock is offset by the other option in the spread.

The $390 call is “in-the-money” because it gives the option buyer the right to buy the stock for $390. Simple math shows that if the stock is trading at $399.26, then the $390 call option is worth $9.26. It works like this. If that option gives me the right to buy the stock at $390.00, and the stock is trading at $399.26, then I can immediately go out into the open market and sell the stock I acquired for $390.00 for $399.26, thus making a $9.26 profit. This portion of the option price is known as the real or intrinsic value of the option.

Shortly thereafter, at point #6, the ticks made new lows, and stayed there. The only time I’ve seen the $TICK hang out around –1,250 and push to –1,500 for an extended length of time is when a panic or a crash is about to hit the market. I say, “about” because although the markets were already down a considerable amount by that point, the real selling hadn’t even started yet. This is why you never buy the dip on days like this. The internals are practically screaming, “This is not a normal day. Something big is about to go down.”

How I handle these readings depends on the trades I’m in and those I’m looking to setup. If I have longer-term trades based on the weekly charts, then I’m not going to let one day’s worth of activity impact those positions. However, if I have shorter-term swing trades in place that typically last a couple of days, I pay attention to this indicator. The real key here is to recognize a spike versus conviction. A spike is usually what happens. The markets are quiet and, boom, we get an extreme reading that lasts for a few minutes, and then it heads back to the zero line. Not a big deal. However, if I get a spike that lasts a few minutes, eases back a bit, and then hits a new, higher level, then conviction is in the markets.

If I’m long intraday and my stop hasn’t been hit and the markets generate a tick reading of –1,000, bounces back to –500, then rolls over and makes a new low, I’ll close out my position at the market.

Over time, I’ve learned to let my convictions go. It is what it is, and the ticks helped me to learn and understand that by helping me cut things loose well before my ego had a chance to step in and destroy my account, all for the sake of possibly being right. Don’t fight the mood of the party. If everyone’s dancing, it’s ok to jump on the table and let out a primal scream and a shout. If, on the other hand, they’re holding a seance and the candles are snuffing out, that would be inappropriate and might get you hurt. This also has the additional benefit of increasing a trader’s risk/reward ratio, as it’s possible in many instances to get out of trades early that would otherwise have been stopped out for the maximum loss.

In addition to repressed emotions, a lot of feelings traders experience stem from focusing on the fear of the unknown, rather than focusing on the risk of the unknown. Fear destroys. Risk can be controlled.

The most bullish days are gap ups where the trin starts off low, say around 0.50, and stays at that level all day long. On such a day, it doesn’t trend lower because it can go only so low and it won’t make it to a zero reading. The sustained lower reading looks like a consolidation pattern on a chart, and it’s extremely bullish. On these types of days, I ignore all short setups, and a breakout to new highs is a buying opportunity.

To illustrate how I use this indicator, let’s assume that the market is made up of exactly 100 participants. Let’s further assume that all 100 of these people are bearish on the markets, and that because of this prevalent feeling, they have established short positions in stocks, ETFs (exchange-traded funds), and index futures, as well as through the buying of puts. With all 100 market participants bearish and now short, a very interesting turn of events takes place. There’s nobody left to sell. With nobody left to sell, the markets don’t have any downward pressure, and they start to drift higher. This drifting eventually hits the first set of stop orders placed in the market by the 100 market participants who are short. Within any given group of traders, some will be using tight stops, some medium stops, and some wide stops. The group of tight stops gets hit first, and this generates fresh buying pressure in the form of short covering that drives the markets higher, right into the next range of stops. This next series of stops kicks off yet another short-covering spree, which, once triggered, drives the markets even higher into the next range of stops, and so on until all the stops are taken out. At this point, the 100 market participants get bullish, and they start buying stocks and index futures, as well as call options. Once they have all scrambled to establish their positions, a very curious thing takes place. There’s nobody left to buy. With nobody left to buy, the markets begin to drift lower and take out the first set of tight stops, which in turn creates enough selling pressure to drive the markets down to the next set of stops, and so forth. It’s a vicious cycle.

A PC ratio of under 0.60 represents extreme call buying and puts a ceiling on the markets. This represents a scenario in which there are too many bulls and very few people left to buy. Now there are lots of sell stops sitting beneath the current levels, just waiting to be hit. This usually happens after the markets have rallied for many days in a row, or after seemingly great earnings or economic news hits the tape. Also, people who have missed the move start chasing it for fear of being left behind. In fact, many times a market will continue rallying until the PC ratio gets under 0.60.

It’s important to realize that the markets spend most of the day—even most weeks—consolidating, resting, backing, filling, and pretty much doing nothing. Traders who wait for a move, and then must chase it will always be at a disadvantage to traders who get in before the move takes place. The way to do this is to watch these internals and look for clues concerning the path of least resistance. When the markets are quiet, get positioned for the next move in this direction. Once the move takes place, the amateurs will chase it, and you can sell your position to them.

One consideration to keep in mind while playing gaps is the 50 percent retracement level. At the beginning of this chapter, I mentioned that I would take half of my position off when there is moderate premarket volume. The reality is, the 50 percent retracement level is the highestprobability exit on any gap. It is okay to modify your trading plan to take off half your profits on any gap that reaches the 50 percent retracement level, regardless of whether premarket volume was moderate or low.

The pivots help to keep a trader grounded. Instead of getting overexcited and hoping for a market crash, the pivot trader knows that there is a 90 percent chance that the markets will not close above R2 or below S2 on any given day. A move to that level signals a time for the trader to take profits instead of pyramiding into a bigger position that will lead to disaster.

The concept of average price is an important one. Any particular market at any given time is either expanding away from its average price or reverting back to its average price—also known as “reverting to the mean.”

In the previous chapter, we discussed reversion to the mean (RTM) trading, and how it’s the best type of trading to do “unless there is a squeeze.” And that really is trading in a nutshell—playing the reversion back to the mean via something like a pivot, an extreme $TICK reading, or an outer reversion band test, and looking for price to go “back” to the mean.

if we know we didn’t choose all these beliefs, it is also true that we agreed to all of them. The agreement is so strong that even if we understand the concept of it not being true, we feel the blame, the guilt, and the shame that occur if we go against these rules. Just as the government has a book of laws that rule the society’s dream, our belief system is the Book of Laws that rules our personal dream. All these laws exist in our mind, we believe them, and the Judge inside us bases everything on these rules. The Judge decrees, and the Victim suffers the guilt and punishment. But who says there is justice in this dream? True justice is paying only once for each mistake. True injustice is paying more than once for each mistake. How many times do we pay for one mistake? The answer is thousands of times. The

In your whole life nobody has ever abused you more than you have abused yourself. And the limit of your self-abuse is exactly the limit that you will tolerate from someone else. If someone abuses you a little more than you abuse yourself, you will probably walk away from that person. But if someone abuses you a little less than you abuse yourself, you will probably stay in the relationship and tolerate it endlessly.

The mitote is the reason humans hardly know what they want, how they want it, or when they want it. They don’t agree with themselves because there are parts of the mind that want one thing, and other parts that want exactly the opposite. Some part of the mind has objections to certain thoughts and actions, and another part supports the actions of the opposing thoughts. All these little living beings create inner conflict because they are alive and they each have a voice. Only by making an inventory of our agreements will we uncover all of the conflicts in the mind and eventually make order out of the chaos of the mitote.

If you can do your best in two hours of meditation, but you spend eight hours instead, you will only grow tired, miss the point, and you won’t enjoy your life.

What research now shows is that different emotions serve different purposes for learning. If we need to engage our critical faculties—if, for instance, we have to edit a letter we’ve written and want to seek out flaws and correct any mistakes—a negative frame of mind might serve us better than its opposite. Pessimism can make it easier for us to anticipate things that could go wrong and then take the proper actions to prevent them. Guilt acts as a moral compass. Anxiety keeps us trying to improve things that a more generous mood might be willing to accept. Even anger is a great motivator—unlike resignation, it drives us to act and perhaps to fix what made us angry in the first place. If we’re furious watching someone being mistreated, we’re likely to step up and seek redress.

Lisa Feldman Barrett, a professor at Northeastern University, recently shared with me that when our “body budget” is running low and we feel distressed, our brains search around for things that might be wrong in our lives to make sense of the distress. When these symptoms present themselves, we don’t always pause to ask: Is there an emotion behind this, and what can I do about it? Or am I just dehydrated or hungry or tired and need to drink or eat something or just go to bed?

Aunque alguna preocupación sobre las cosas es normal, si excesiva, puede dejar a la persona sumida en la indecisión, y la indecisión causa confusión. Preguntarse, la indecisión y la confusión impiden que una persona reciba de Dios, por fe, la respuesta a su necesidad u oración.

Santiago 1:5-8 es una porción excelente de las Escrituras que nos ayuda a comprender cómo vencer la indecisión, la duda y la confusión, y recibir lo que necesitamos de Dios. Para mí, el “hombre de doble ánimo” (la versión de La Biblia al Día dice “la mente del que duda”) es el cuadro de la confusión mientras él constantemente va hacia delante y hacia atrás, adelante y atrás, sin decidir nunca cosa alguna. Tan pronto él piensa que ha tomado una decisión, le atacan la indecisión, la duda y la confusión para ponerlo otra vez entre dos opciones. Duda con respecto a todo.

Con frecuencia Satanás nos roba la voluntad de Dios por medio del razonamiento. El Señor puede guiarnos a hacer ciertas cosas, pero si no tienen sentido—si no nos parecen lógicas—podemos sentirnos tentados a descartarlas. Lo que Dios guía a una persona a hacer no siempre tiene sentido lógico para su mente. Su espíritu puede afirmarlo y su mente rechazarlo, especialmente si se sale de lo ordinario o es desagradable o si implica sacrificio o incomodidad personal. Siempre es bueno si el espíritu y la mente están de acuerdo, pero si no, debemos elegir seguir al espíritu.

Ahora comprendo que me sentía más segura si entendía todas las cosas. No quería ningún cabo suelto en mi vida. Deseaba tener el control de todo; y cuando no lo entendía todo, sentía que no tenía control; me atemorizaba. Pero me faltaba algo. No tenía paz en mi mente y físicamente me agotaba razonando. Este tipo de continua actividad mental indebida llegará incluso a agotar el cuerpo físico. ¡Te puede dejar exhausto! Dios me precisó para que desistiera, y yo le recomiendo muy encarecidamente lo mismo a cualquiera que sea adicto a razonar. Sí, dije adicto a razonar. Podemos volvernos adictos a la actividad mental indebida lo mismo que otro puede hacerse adicto al alcohol, las drogas o la nicotina. Yo era adicta a razonar y cuando renuncié a ello, tuve síntomas de carencia como los drogadictos. Me sentí perdida y asustada porque no sabía lo que estaba sucediendo. Llegué a sentirme aburrida.

Me había pasado tanto tiempo razonando, que cuando desistí de hacerlo, tuve que acostumbrarme a que mi mente estuviera en reposo. Durante un tiempo pareció aburrido, pero ahora me encanta. A pesar de que antes tenía funcionando mi mente todo el tiempo razonándolo todo vez tras vez, ahora no puedo soportar el esfuerzo y la angustia de razonar. El razonar no es la condición normal en que Dios quiere que nuestra mente permanezca. Date cuenta de que no es normal que la mente esté llena de razonamientos. Al menos, no para el cristiano que trata de conseguir la victoria; el creyente que intenta ganar la guerra que se libra en el campo de batalla de la mente.

En lo que concierne a entrar en el reposo de Dios, me gustaría decir esto: no existe eso que llamamos “el reposo de Dios” sin oposición. Cuando no hay nada de que preocuparse pudiéramos experimentar una paz como cualquier persona más en el mundo que no tiene problemas, pero el “reposo de Dios” que nos mantiene en paz en medio de los problemas está disponible para todos los que creen. Para ilustrar este punto, les contaré una historia que oí una vez, respecto a dos artistas a quienes se les pidió que pintaran cuadros de la paz tal como ellos la concebían. Uno pintó un lago apacible entre las montañas. El otro pintó una tumultuosa cascada rugiente, sobre la que se inclinaban las ramas de un abedul, en una de las cuales había un nido donde descansaba un pájaro. ¿Cuál de ellos representaba verdaderamente la paz? El segundo, porque no existe esa cosa llamada paz sin oposición. El primer cuadro representa el estancamiento. La escena que presenta puede ser serena; una persona puede sentir deseos de ir allí para recuperarse.

Jesús declaró: La paz os dejo, mi paz os doy; no os la doy como el mundo la da… (Juan 14:27). Su paz es una paz espiritual, y Su reposo es el que se manifiesta en medio de la tormenta… no en su ausencia. Jesús no vino a quitar toda la oposición de nuestras vidas, sino más bien a darnos una visión diferente de las tormentas de la vida. Hemos de aceptar Su yugo sobre nosotros y aprender de Él (Mateo 11:29.) Eso significa que hemos de aprender Sus modos, a ver la vida del mismo modo que Él la ve.

Con frecuencia me digo: “Joyce, no es asunto tuyo”. Es un problema grave elaborar mentalmente en tanto ponderas tu opinión hasta que se convierte en juicio. El problema crece y empeora cuanto más piensas en él hasta que empiezas a expresárselo a otros, o incluso a aquél a quien estás juzgando. Entonces se ha convertido en explosivo y tiene la capacidad de hacer mucho daño en el campo de la relación, así como en el campo espiritual. Puedes ahorrarte problemas futuros aprendiendo a decir simplemente: “No es asunto mío”.

Al diablo le encanta mantenernos ocupados, juzgando mentalmente las faltas de otros. De ese modo, ¡nunca vemos o tratamos con lo que está mal en nosotros! No podemos cambiar a otros; sólo Dios puede hacerlo. Tampoco podemos cambiarnos a nosotros mismos, pero podemos cooperar con el Espíritu Santo y permitirle que haga la obra. Sin embargo, el Primer Paso en cualquier liberación, es enfrentarnos a la verdad que el Señor está tratando de mostrarnos.

Cuando pensamos, y conversamos, de lo que está mal en todos los demás, usualmente nos estamos dejando engañar con respecto a nuestra propia conducta. Por consiguiente, Jesús nos ordena que no nos metamos en lo que está mal en otros, cuando hay tantas cosas mal en nosotros. Permite que Dios trate primero contigo, y entonces aprenderás la forma bíblica de ayudar a tu hermano a crecer en su andar cristiano.

GUARDA TU CORAZÓN Con toda diligencia guarda tu corazón, porque de él brotan los manantiales de la vida. Proverbios 4:23 Si quieres que la vida fluya hacia ti y desde ti, guarda tu corazón. Cierta clase de pensamientos son “impensables” para un creyente; entre ellos, el enjuiciamiento y la crítica. Todas las cosas que Dios trata de enseñarnos son para nuestro propio bien y felicidad. Seguir Sus caminos trae fecundidad; seguir los caminos del diablo, trae corrupción.

Pon siempre tu confianza fundamental y máxima en el Señor. Al hacer esto le abres la puerta al Espíritu Santo para que te haga saber cuándo estás traspasando la línea del equilibrio. Algunas personas piensan que tienen discernimiento cuando en realidad sólo son suspicaces. Hay un verdadero don del Espíritu llamado discernimiento de espíritus (1 Corintios 12:10). Él discierne lo bueno y lo malo, no únicamente lo malo. La sospecha proviene de la mente no renovada; el discernimiento brota del espíritu renovado.

Hay pecados activos o de comisión, y hay pecados pasivos o de omisión. En otras palabras, hay cosas malas que hacemos, y hay cosas buenas que no hacemos. Por ejemplo, una relación puede destruirse por decir palabras irreflexivas, pero también puede destruirse por omitir palabras amables de agradecimiento que debieron haberse pronunciado pero nunca se dijeron. Una persona pasiva piensa que no está haciendo nada malo porque no está haciendo nada. Confrontado con su error, dirá: “¡Yo no hice nada!” Lo que dice es correcto, pero su conducta no. El problema surge precisamente porque no hizo nada.

Demasiado a menudo, cuando la gente se deprime, es porque necesita algo, y lo busca donde no debe, con lo que sólo añade a sus problemas. En Jeremías 2:13 el Señor dice: Porque dos males ha hecho mi pueblo: me han abandonado a mí, fuente de aguas vivas, y han cavado para sí cisternas, cisternas agrietadas que no retienen el agua. Únicamente Dios puede calmar la sed del sediento. No te dejes engañar pensando que cualquier otra cosa puede satisfacerte del todo y por completo. Correr tras las cosas equivocadas siempre te dejará decepcionado, y la decepción abre la puerta a la depresión.

In rare moments, you may even feel the heart of a warrior, extending compassion to those around you. But these qualities are fragmented in you. You lack integration. My task is to put you back together again, Humpty.”

Meanwhile, improving by 1 percent isn’t particularly notable—sometimes it isn’t even noticeable—but it can be far more meaningful, especially in the long run. The difference a tiny improvement can make over time is astounding. Here’s how the math works out: if you can get 1 percent better each day for one year, you’ll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you’re done. Conversely, if you get 1 percent worse each day for one year, you’ll decline nearly down to zero. What starts as a small win or a minor setback accumulates into something much more.

We often expect progress to be linear. At the very least, we hope it will come quickly. In reality, the results of our efforts are often delayed. It is not until months or years later that we realize the true value of the previous work we have done. This can result in a “valley of disappointment” where people feel discouraged after putting in weeks or months of hard work without experiencing any results. However, this work was not wasted. It was simply being stored. It is not until much later that the full value of previous efforts is revealed.

But if you maintain the same sloppy, pack-rat habits that led to a messy room in the first place, soon you’ll be looking at a new pile of clutter and hoping for another burst of motivation. You’re left chasing the same outcome because you never changed the system behind it. You treated a symptom without addressing the cause.

Achieving a goal only changes your life for the moment. That’s the counterintuitive thing about improvement. We think we need to change our results, but the results are not the problem. What we really need to change are the systems that cause those results. When you solve problems at the results level, you only solve them temporarily. In order to improve for good, you need to solve problems at the systems level. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.

A systems-first mentality provides the antidote. When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running. And a system can be successful in many different forms, not just the one you first envision.

Problem #4: Goals are at odds with long-term progress. Finally, a goal-oriented mind-set can create a “yo-yo” effect. Many runners work hard for months, but as soon as they cross the finish line, they stop training. The race is no longer there to motivate them. When all of your hard work is focused on a particular goal, what is left to push you forward after you achieve it? This is why many people find themselves reverting to their old habits after accomplishing a goal.

Problem #4: Goals are at odds with long-term progress. Finally, a goal-oriented mind-set can create a “yo-yo” effect. Many runners work hard for months, but as soon as they cross the finish line, they stop training. The race is no longer there to motivate them. When all of your hard work is focused on a particular goal, what is left to push you forward after you achieve it? This is why many people find themselves reverting to their old habits after accomplishing a goal. The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress.

If a behavior is insufficient in any of the four stages, it will not become a habit. Eliminate the cue and your habit will never start. Reduce the craving and you won’t experience enough motivation to act. Make the behavior difficult and you won’t be able to do it. And if the reward fails to satisfy your desire, then you’ll have no reason to do it again in the future. Without the first three steps, a behavior will not occur. Without all four, a behavior will not be repeated.

The impact created by a change in your habits is similar to the effect of shifting the route of an airplane by just a few degrees. Imagine you are flying from Los Angeles to New York City. If a pilot leaving from LAX adjusts the heading just 3.5 degrees south, you will land in Washington, D.C., instead of New York. Such a small change is barely noticeable at takeoff—the nose of the airplane moves just a few feet—but when magnified across the entire United States, you end up hundreds of miles apart.*

Similarly, a slight change in your daily habits can guide your life to a very different destination. Making a choice that is 1 percent better or 1 percent worse seems insignificant in the moment, but over the span of moments that make up a lifetime these choices determine the difference between who you are and who you could be.

When you have repeated a story to yourself for years, it is easy to slide into these mental grooves and accept them as a fact. In time, you begin to resist certain actions because “that’s not who I am.” There is internal pressure to maintain your self-image and behave in a way that is consistent with your beliefs. You find whatever way you can to avoid contradicting yourself.

“This is what I am also trying to work on every day. Accept the loss, and move on to the next opportunity. As new traders, we want every trade to be a winning trade, and it makes us hold on to losers, expecting them to bounce back and turn to winners, and that is where we get burned badly. Worse is when those trades we hold on to actually become winners! Yes, feels good on the P&L, but the bad habit that it creates will cost us big time in the future.”

Dealing with the fact that every day includes failures is difficult for me. I am a perfectionist, and trading is murder on perfectionists. Why? Because no setup is perfect and every setup is unique like a snowflake. Yes, patterns repeat, but each time it needs to be assessed with fresh, clear eyes. Not only that, even winning days are full of small mistakes and things that could be improved upon. In many other areas of life perfection is a worthy goal, but not so with trading.”

the statistic of expected value [“EV”] to evaluate my performance (i.e., EV = (% Winners x Average Win) – (% Losers x Average Loss)). The reason for this is that it is impossible to diagnose and remediate bad trading behavior when a trader is only aware of their profit/loss. Even a profitable trader may not be able to articulate how they are successful if they are only aware of their profit/loss and may not know what to target in order to correct for periods of bad trading.

Although some novice traders naïvely expect that the majority of their trades will be profitable, the fact is that a very large percentage of trades actually lose money.

Set realistic goals. I took a few psychology courses on goal setting at university for my degree and they all seem to agree. Break the goal up into small obtainable steps and build momentum. So, don’t say, ‘I want to be a billionaire in 5 years.’ Reframe it as, ‘In 5 years, I’d like to have my house paid off entirely, and I’m going to do it by ...’ A goal too far out of reach or without structure is useless, even if there’s a slim chance.

If a behavior is insufficient in any of the four stages, it will not become a habit. Eliminate the cue and your habit will never start. Reduce the craving and you won’t experience enough motivation to act. Make the behavior difficult and you won’t be able to do it. And if the reward fails to satisfy your desire, then you’ll have no reason to do it again in the future. Without the first three steps, a behavior will not occur. Without all four, a behavior will not be repeated.

In my experience, the people who have the most fun, feel the most confident, and realize it’s just a game always come out ahead. They may not have the most money in the bank, but they remain unattached to the outcome of “winning” or having “the most” and enjoy the process—the give-and-take. They focus on “feeling” like a winner rather than on actually winning.

Tu autoridad espiritual respecto a tu esposa y familia es sin rival. Y debido a que la misma procede de Dios, se debe usar de acuerdo con propósito de Dios. Lo que debe motivar nuestra autoridad es su amor y debe servir para su gloria. Toda la autoridad espiritual que Dios nos otorgó tiene como fundamento una humildad que desea servir a Dios en vez de controlar a los demás. Dios desea que lo sirvas ejerciendo tu autoridad sobre el enemigo.

Esto significa que cualquier cosa que le suceda a uno de ustedes le afectará al otro. Si ella es feliz, tú eres feliz. Si tú eres bendecido, ella será bendecida. Y por supuesto, lo contrario también es cierto. Si ella no está contenta, definitivamente tú tampoco lo estarás. Sus problemas son tus problemas, así como los tuyos son los de ella. Por eso es que tus oraciones por ella son tan cruciales. Afectarán a ambos.

Someterse es un verbo. La sumisión es una acción voluntaria. Esto significa que es algo que nosotros mismos hacemos. No es algo que obligamos a otra persona hacer. De la misma manera que no podemos forzar a una persona a que nos ame, tampoco podemos forzarla a ser sumisa a nosotros. Por supuesto, podemos lograr que tal persona haga lo que queremos, pero eso no es verdadera sumisión. La sumisión es una decisión propia. Es algo que cada uno de nosotros debe decidir hacer. Y esta es una decisión que en primer lugar sucede en el corazón

Ora también para que Dios te dé sabiduría al dirigir a tu familia y tomar decisiones correctas. Con frecuencia, las dudas de tu esposa en cuanto a seguirte no es porque desconfíe de ti, sino porque confía más en Dios. Ella cree que Él es el único que conoce ciertas cosas, y quiere saber que tú procuraste Su sabiduría y tomarás decisiones basadas en Su voluntad. Ella necesita estar segura de que tú consideraste seriamente el futuro de ustedes dos como familia al tomar todas las decisiones. Ora para que tu confianza en Dios sea tan evidente, que tu esposa pueda a su vez confiar que Dios está obrando a través de ti, y que desea lo mejor para ella y la familia.

Caballeros, las mujeres necesitan saber que pueden confiar en nosotros. A pesar de lo que diga el movimiento feminista, las mujeres quieren un hombre que dirija, y quieren saber que pueden confiar en él. Así que, cuando hoy ores pidiendo que aumente la confianza de tu esposa, debes también orar para ser cada vez más un hombre digno de confianza. Por ejemplo, si en secreto usaste las finanzas de la familia, sin consultar a tu esposa, esto es un destructor de confianza. Para recuperar su confianza en esta área, acude a ella con un corazón arrepentido y con un plan de acción sobre cómo piensas cambiar tu comportamiento. Por último, eres la imagen de nuestro Padre Dios ante tu esposa e hijos. Si eres confiable, a tu esposa e hijos les será mucho más fácil confiar en su Padre celestial.

Worse yet, when facing adversity, you lean into low-self-esteem and quitting because you think you are not strong enough to overcome—- you believe strength is a special trait for other people, not you.

Unfortunately, we live in a time where society teaches us to avoid discomfort at all costs. Truth is, discomfort is a vital part of the growing process. Climbing requires us to push against resistance—gravity. And when we do this continuously for miles and miles, our muscles naturally ache. Climbing makes you feel everything. My favorite thing about climbing is that it strengthens you. Resistance is the best way to strengthen your body, whether by lifting, pulling a weight, or pushing your body up an incline. The truth is, getting strong hurts.

It’s safe to say, a lot of us give up too soon. At the first sight of discomfort or letdown, we throw in the towel and assume we are on the wrong path or maybe we aren’t capable of overcoming. I’m not sure how we were led to believe that the hard things in life are impossible mountains to climb, but it would be wise if we start looking at those enormous mountains and start climbing them— it’s how we get stronger.

The one common theme that runs throughout is resilience. This was also inspired by research in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology which found, ‘The importance of intellectual talent to achievement in all professional domains is well established, but less is known about the importance of resilience. Defined as perseverance and passion for long-term goals … resilience did not relate positively to IQ, but demonstrated incremental predictive validity of success measures over and beyond IQ. These findings suggest that the achievement of difficult goals entails not only talent but also the sustained and focused application of talent over time.’

There is no doubt in my mind that strength underpins everything we do and it is the accumulation of strength over a period of time that allows all of our body’s structures to adapt and make us more able to deal with the stresses and strains that we place upon it. Whether that’s bones, muscles, joints, ligaments or tendons: all of these structures have the ability to adapt to the forces that are placed upon them. If we load too quickly and have not accustomed our body and its structures to the loads that we intend to place on it, then we will almost certainly pick up some form of injury. On the other hand, if we increase the load gradually while incorporating some rest and recovery time (which allows the body to adapt further) then we become stronger and more resilient.’ I

First, I had no idea how to land clients, so I studied and experimented with multiple techniques I could find on the internet. Second, I realized that a single skill wasn’t enough to get the results that would allow me to charge higher prices, so I started learning marketing, sales, and writing. Third, I knew that I couldn’t increase my income beyond a certain point with manual client acquisition, so I started building distribution by posting content in public to attract a following. By solving those 3 problems over the course of a year, I gained more deep knowledge (and made more money) than my 4 years at college would ever allow me to.

Information leads to awareness of opportunity. Awareness of opportunity leads to valuable ideas. Valuable ideas lead to positive behavior change, not only in yourself, but in others. Positive behavior change ripples from the individual to community to society and beyond. One can argue that the spread of valuable information is one of the greatest goods you can do. Now, manipulation of information can lead to death, destruction, and getting trapped in your own head. But we are here to focus on the positive implications of the information age we live in, thus breathing more life into it.

Creative work is the vessel for impacting the minds of others, but don’t be mistaken, this is a spiritual battle. When you peel back the veil of labels, limits, and distinctions, everything we do is to transfer our quality of experience from one to another until we reach the collective experience of the Universe.

Value creators are obsessive reality explorers. They don’t build to make money, they make money to build. They research their obsessions and distill their learnings with articulate writing or speaking that is persuasively distributed to the public. They get paid for aggregated knowledge and experience in their products, even if those products aren’t information products. Lastly, they prioritize education of their attracted community to the point of positive behavior change.

To reiterate the entirety of this path, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, seek to understand and experience the patterns of the Universe; they can teach you more than any words, form, or interpretation. Notice how it ebbs and flows. Across all planes of reality, there is creation, destruction, give, take, birth, and death with an invisible glue holding it all together that we call spirit.

and as you experience the full range of the human experience, align your decisions with the perspective of your ideal self. This is done through creating an actualization hierarchy of goals, moving forward, moving back, learning, and solving problems that reflect on a Universal level. You are the Universe, but there are many limitations you have accepted that prevent you from realizing who you are. You burst through these limitations by making progress and doing the inner work necessary to avoid getting lost in the game.
